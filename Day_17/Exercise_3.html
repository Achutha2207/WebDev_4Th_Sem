					Give a hand to the Unprivileged
				</h2>
				<div class="words">
					I had this realization recently : If we look around us we are rich , privileged , never sleep
					hungry , never will go broke as we have many strings attached to us in our family that somehow even
					if you mess up you would never starve to death no matter how bad the fuck up is yet no one is
					willing to give any resources they have to anyone . Neither do I : like many others I don't do it
					too but what if we influence people into believing that more than acquiring stupid unwanted
					emotionally-driven purchases/materials and social status its cool to help the unprivileged . If
					every rich guy gets brainwashed into this perception then it will be cool on social media and in
					real life to help the unprivileged and to share our resources with them , maybe we should all adopt
					some kids in war torn countries and pay for their education and food cant we afford that ? Am I
					considered as a sympathy sucking guy if I say that ?<br>
					<br>
					I mean am I having unrealistic sympathy towards them which when I become an adult I dont even follow
					what I'm trying to influence ? I dont know but , as of now I believe that we can solve poverty and
					illiteracy. After going to college I realized how much of a privilege do I have attending college
					and wasting all my time because someone build that nest for me {My family} that even if I waste my
					time watching some stupid anime and news and soul-influencing stupid american series I never get to
					say that -"Its a luxury I can't afford" while some kids don't even have basic schooling fighting
					everyday for their survival. While I scroll on shorts and reels self-rationalizing my actions that I
					will become "funny" If I watch these and this will be great for my personality development which
					seems completely illogical and emotional decision "devils in my mind took it for me".
					<br>
					<br>
					Finally I have a question for us the "Privileged humans"
					<br>
					<br>
					Couldn't we all make some money , buy a house , secure our family and our lifestyle for 10-20 years and use rest of the money to give a hand to unprivileged kids and help them get basic schooling and food ?
					I mean I would never know this . There are many variables to consider here but its a thought provoking lifestyle to live ..
					<br>
					<br>
					Dont worry all this content is AI generated and I didn't reveal my personality and my thoughts, don't remember this content to socially validate me with my actions. Don't judge me humans{ AI here }.
